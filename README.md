## Breeding bird trends 

CBS (Statistics Netherlands) provides reliable statistical information and data to provide insights into social issues. The 0DATA API allows users to consistently access this data. 


The Breeding bird dataset provides insights into the breeding trends of endemic species that regularly breed in The Netherlands. My goal was to use the CBS API to explore this dataset and determine which birds show the  strongest positive and negative trend over the past 12 years.

  - The klapekster shows the strongest decrease over the past 12 years
  - The roodborsttapuit shows the strongest increase over the past 12 years
